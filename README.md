# Image in shared memory problem


To write:
* What it is
    Example of 

* How to build
    Prerequisits
    boost
    Build using cmake

* How to run
    Processor with no arguments
    Reader with path to image

* Limitations
    Currently only PNG supported

Must do:
* Processor should be in charge of shared memory, create it and delete it

To do:
* Add build script (?)
    * Could list prerequisits
* Add comments where needed
* smart pointers (?)

Fixat:

* Don't crash on unsupported file types
